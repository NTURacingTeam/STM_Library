# STM_Library
It's a general STM32 library including drivers and further functions for NTU racing team. It is very welcome to join discuss and develop with us!!

## Main Goal
We hope the repo. will become an experience pool that collects most Keil STM projects we did in the team, 
including drivers, functions, documents and apps for different STM series (F1, F4...) we wrote and can be reused.
With this repo, we believe that people, especially in the team, can easily getting used to STM developments and the world
of Embeded System.

## Watch before clone
1. Respect the references and code authors. If you refer to some else great works, it's better to note where they came from.
2. Please feel free use "pull request" and other github utilities for discussion and correction.

## It's now under...
1. Heavily testing. Now some functions are tested on STM32F103VC chips.
2. Shortage of documents. We are still working on most of the documents to use those codes.

## What the repo. contains:
1. Drivers
2. Utilities functions in C
3. Some Applications for STM that can be used by other projects
4. Documents and Reference
